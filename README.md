# employee-tracker

Design and build a solution for managing a company's employees.

Three tables are defined within the company's employee database. One table defines the employees (id, first name, last name, role id and manager id), a second defines the roles an employee may have (id, title, salary and deparment id), and the third defines the various departments (id and name) within the company.

The application utilizes a
 command line interface (CLI) and begins by listing a series of actions from which the user (business owner) may chose an action to perform.

The actions to choose from currently include:

  * View all departments in the company
  * View all roles within the company
  * View all employees of the company

  * Add a department to the department table
  * Add a role to the role table
  * Add an employee to the employee table

  * Update an employee's role

  * Delete an employee
